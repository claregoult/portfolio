<h2 class="section-title">The Process</h2>


<h3 class="sub-section-title">Your request for proposal (RFP)</h3>

<p>Once you contact me I’ll send you a questionnaire which will seek to determine your goals, expectations and the requirements of the project. Providing me with your expectations helps me to understand your vision.</p>

<p>Because I’m selective in the clients I accept it’s mutually beneficial. Some of the factors I consider are your passion for your product, the goals and objectives, and your level trust in me and my ability to deliver (which allows you can focus your time in other areas of your business).</p>


</div>

<div class="content-container">
<blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Design should be considerate of the goals and work to achieve them in the best way possible.</p></blockquote>
</div>
</section>
<section>
<div class="content-container indented">

<h3 class="sub-section-title">Starting Out</h3>

Trust is the most important thing in a working relationship. I’ll take you through every step of the project. I’ll explain how it’s going to work, when it’s going to happen, and what is required of you.

<p>I’ll also setup your project in Asana (the project management system I use) where we’ll be able communicate and keep up-to-date with the progress of the project with tasks. You will have your own task list to complete (e.g. uploading content or filling in the questionnaire).</p>

<p>Let’s focus on how we can make you more successful through well thought-out design and exceptional value. This means lots of questions and asking why so I can uncover any hidden problems or needs that can be solved or met. That is why the questionnaire is so comprehensive, so I can get as much information as possible.</p>


<h3 class="sub-section-title">Proposal</h3>

<p>Once you’ve answered everything in the questionnaire I’ll go through it and condense your answers down into a proposal for your project that will give you the possible best offer. The proposal will include the work I will carry out, the deliverables you’ll receive and at what stage, and the cost of the project. When the proposal is signed and a 25% (of the total cost of the project) deposit paid I’ll get started to the fun stuff!</p>
</div>
</section>

<section>
<div class="content-container indented">

<h2 class="section-title">Creative Process</h2>

<h3 class="sub-section-title">Research</h3>
<p>During this step I will begin focusing on enhancing my understanding of the type of industry which I am designing for. To do this I look specifically at similar organisations, target customer demographics, and research the industry’s history and trends. This also gives you the opportunity to complete the pre-work task list in Asana and ask me any questions you might have about the project.</p>

<h3 class="sub-section-title">Content Strategy</h3>
<p>After the researching stage I will begin content strategy. This starts with an audit of any existing content or any intended content. Knowing the information architecture allows me to determine the best way to organise and structure that information, which improves the user experience.</p>

<p>For Websites, I will also create a user-flow map to plan and design the user’s journey through the site. This allows us to create a meaningful experience for your users and focuses them on a specific action or task.</p>


<h3 class="sub-section-title">Design Preposition</h3>
<p>Once I have the initial two stages out of the way it’s time to begin the design phase. I start this by creating a mood-board. This will be presented to you to ensure the project is moving in the right direction.</p>

<h3 class="sub-section-title">Ideas Generation</h3>
<p>The first idea might seem appealing but if you don’t explore all the possible ideas how do you know it works the best? I will sketch out ideas and then decide on the best one to show you. Some designers offer multiple designs at this stage but I think it’s the designer’s job to provide the best solution. For logos, this might be a little different. I’ll present you with three design concepts and we’ll discuss them and go from there.</p>


<h3 class="sub-section-title">Development and Refinement</h3>
<p>Once you sign-off on the design I’ll get started on coding your Website. I will keep you up to date with the progress of the build. I will also test your Website in multiple browsers and on multiple devices to make sure it works correctly for as many devices as possible.</p>

<p>For logos and branding, after the concept and direction are outlined I’ll begin digitising the design or put together a style guide. As always, I’ll provide you with plenty of opportunities for feedback or to ask any questions.</p>

<h3 class="sub-section-title">Delivery</h3>
<p>After the final invoice has been paid your Website will go live (if applicable) and you’ll get any other deliverables (such as your logo or branding materials). I’ll also provide you with a guide on using and maintaining your Website, logo and/or branding assets.</p>

<p>You can also find the deliverables and assets on the client area specifically created for your project(s) on my Website.</p>

<section class="faq" id="faq">
<div class="content-container indented">
<h2 class="section-title">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3 class="sub-section-title">How will I get my files at the end?</h3>

<h4 class="smaller-sub-section-title">Website:</h4>
<p>
I will send you a copy of the website’s design in a Sketch file as well as a PDF file. Individual assets such as icons or images will be packaged up in the relevant file formats.</p>

<p>If you’ve chosen for me to host the site (see packages below for details) then I’ll handle setting up hosting and getting your website up and running for you. I will also provide you with the login details and a guide to using it. If I am also to do regular updates or maintenance then I’ll also setup recurring billing (see packages above for details).
</p>

<p>If you’re hosting the site yourself then I’ll send you a ZIP file along with a set of setup instructions to setup yourself. You could also ask your hosting provider to set it up for you.</p>

<h4 class="smaller-sub-section-title">Logo:</h4>
<p>I will send you the logo as an EPS file and a PDF file. I’ll also provide you with a set of instructions on how to use the logo.</p>

<h4 class="smaller-sub-section-title">Branding:</h4>
<p>I’ll send you a style guide an Illustrator file (.ai) and a PDF file. Any other assets for the branding will be packaged up in their relevant file formats.</p>




<h3 class="sub-section-title">Do I have to have all the website content?</h3>


<p>Yes. The more you can get before I start designing the better. There is no real substitute for real-world content as content tends to impact the design and the approach you take when designing. A content-first approach provides a better gauge of if a design is working than using so-called dummy content and placeholders. Delays in sending the content will cause delays to the project.</p>

<p>You can find this task in Asana under the pre-work section. All the pre-work tasks will need to be complete before the project can move forward.</p>




<h3 class="sub-section-title">How long does it take?</h3>

<p>My efficiency is dependant upon your ability to reply to communications in a timely manner, though I do strive to meet deadlines. Because all projects are different the timeframe can vary. It’s difficult to give a complete estimate in the initial dialogue because I don’t fully know the goals, requirements or scope of the project. You can see what stage we’re at with the project in Asana.
</p>

<h3 class="sub-section-title">What do I have to provide?</h3>

<p>Here is a list of the items you might need to provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Domain name</li>
<li>Hosting account login details (if you aren't hosting with me)</li>
<li>All the text for website (for each main page)</li>
<li>Any images/illustrations/graphics (e.g. photos of yourself)</li>
<li>Any inspiration you might have gathered</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="sub-section-title">Do you provide hosting?</h3>

<p>Yes, I provide hosting as a service or as part of the Premium Package (free for 12 months). You can out more below in the packages section. If you wish to host the site elsewhere then I can help you in finding the right hosting provider for your needs.</p>

<p>I do not provide domain names. However, here are some popular domain name vendors for you to choose from:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://123-reg.co.uk">123 Reg</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://hover.com">Hover</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://name.com">Name.com</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://namecheap.co">Namecheap</a></li>
