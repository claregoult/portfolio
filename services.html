<h2 class="section-title">The Process</h2>


<h3 class="sub-section-title">Your request for proposal (RFP)</h3>

<p>Once you contact me I’ll send you a questionnaire which will seek to determine your goals, expectations and the requirements of the project. Providing me with your expectations helps me to understand your vision.</p>

<p>Because I’m selective in the clients I accept it’s mutually benecial. Some of the factors I consider are your passion for your product or service, the goals and objectives, and your level trust in me and my ability to deliver (which means you can focus your time in other areas of your business).</p>

<h3 class="sub-section-title">Starting Out</h3>

<p>Trust is the most important thing in a working relationship. To that end, I’ll take you through every step of the project. I’ll explain how it’s going to work, when it’s going to happen, and what is required of you.</p>

<p>I cannot tell you exactly how much the project will cost initially without discussing your goals and requirements (see the <a href="#faq">FAQ below</a>). This means lots of questions and asking &lsquo;why&rsquo; so I can uncover any hidden problems or needs that can be solved or met. That is why the questionnaire is so comprehensive, so I can get as much information as possible.</p>

<h3 class="sub-section-title">Proposal</h3>

<p>Once you’ve answered everything in the questionnaire I’ll go through it and condense your answers down into a proposal for your project that will give you the possible best offer. The proposal will include the work I will carry out, and the deliverables you’ll receive and when. When the proposal is signed and you pay the deposit I’ll get started on the fun stuff!</p>

<h2 class="section-title">Creative Process</h2>

<h3 class="sub-section-title">Research</h3>
<p>During this step I will begin focusing on enhancing my understanding of the type of industry which I am designing for. To do this I look specifically at similar organisations, target customer demographics, and research the industry’s history and trends.</p>

<h3 class="sub-section-title">Content Strategy</h3>
<p>After the researching stage I will begin content strategy. This starts with an audit of any existing content, or intended content. Knowing the information architecture allows me to determine the best way to organise and structure that information, which improves the user experience.</p>

<p>For websites, I will also create a user-flow map to plan and design the user’s journey through the site. This allows us to create a meaningful experience for your users and focuses them on a specific action or task.</p>

<h3 class="sub-section-title">Design Preposition</h3>
<p>Once I have the initial two stages out of the way it’s time to begin the design phase. I start this by creating a mood-board. This will be presented to you to ensure the project is moving in the right direction.</p>

<h3 class="sub-section-title">Ideas Generation</h3>
<p>The first idea might seem appealing but if you don’t explore all the possible ideas how do you know it works the best? I will sketch out ideas and then decide on the best one to show you. Some designers offer multiple website designs at this stage but I think it’s the designer’s job to provide the best solution, so that's why I present you with one concept. However, I’ll present you with three design concepts for a logo and we’ll discuss what you do and don't like, and go from there.</p>
<h3 class="sub-section-title">Development and Refinement</h3>
<p>Once you're happy with the site and I have your approval to move on, I’ll get started on coding your website. I will keep you up to date with the progress of the build through Asana (a project management tool). I will also test your website in multiple browsers, as well as on multiple devices to make sure it works correctly for as many devices as possible.</p>

<p>For logos and branding, after the concept and direction are outlined I’ll begin digitising the design or put together a style guide. As always, I’ll provide you with plenty of opportunities for feedback or to ask any questions.</p>

<h3 class="sub-section-title">Delivery</h3>
<p>After the final invoice has been paid your website will go live (if applicable) and you’ll get any other deliverables (e.g. your logo or branding materials). I’ll also provide you with a guide on using and updating your website content, logo and/or branding assets.</p>

<h2 class="section-title">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3 class="sub-section-title">How will I get my files at the end?</h3>

<h4 class="smaller-sub-section-title">Website:</h4>
<p>
I will send you a copy of the website design in a Sketch file as well as a PDF file. Individual assets such as icons or images will be packaged up in the relevant file formats.</p>

<p>If I’m setting up hosting and getting your website up and running for you then I’ll provide you with the login details and a guide to using it. If I to do regular updates or maintenance then I’ll also setup recurring billing. Be aware that this is a separate service and will be in addition to web design work.</p>

<p>If you’re hosting the site yourself then I’ll send you a ZIP file along with a set of setup instructions to setup yourself. You could also ask your hosting provider to set it up for you.</p>

<h4 class="smaller-sub-section-title">Logo:</h4>
<p>I will send you the logo as an EPS file and a PDF file. I’ll also provide you with a set of instructions on how to use the logo.</p>

<h4 class="smaller-sub-section-title">Branding:</h4>
<p>I’ll send you a style guide an Illustrator file (.ai) and a PDF file. Any other assets for the branding will be packaged up in their relevant file formats.</p>




<h3 class="sub-section-title">Do I have to have all the website content?</h3>

<p>The more you can get before I start designing the better. There is no real substitute for real-world content as content tends to impact the design and the approach you take when designing. A content-first approach provides a better gauge of if a design is working than using so-called dummy content and placeholders.</p>

<p>By the development stage however I will need all the digital assets ( photography, logo, etc). I do not provide copywriting so any text also needs to be delivered. Please be aware that delays in sending the content will cause delays to the project.</p>

<p>I suggest that once you initially contact me &mdash; or even prior to that &mdash; gather as much content as you can.</p>



<h3 class="sub-section-title">How long does it take?</h3>

<p>My efficiency is dependant upon your ability to reply to emails and other communication in a timely manner, however I do strive to meet deadlines. Because all projects are different the timeframe can vary. It’s especially difficult to give an estimate in the initial conversation because, of course, I don’t know the goals, requirements or scope of the project.</p>

<h3 class="sub-section-title">What do I have to provide?</h3>

<p>Here is a list of the items you might need to provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Domain name</li>
<li>Hosting account login details (if you aren't hosting with me)</li>
<li>All the text for website (for each main page)</li>
<li>Any images/illustrations/graphics (e.g. photos of yourself)</li>
<li>Any inspiration you might have gathered</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="sub-section-title">Do you provide hosting?</h3>

<p>I offer hosting as an additional service which includes maintanance (such as security updates) and site backups for your peace of mind. Additionally, your site isn't stored on a shared server so it's not sharing resources with other websites on the network. This has two benefits: performance is greatly increased and your site is secure from malicious sites sharing the server.</p>

<p> I do not currently offer domain names, however, so you'll need to provide one. Don't worry if you need help with that then I'm happy to work with you to choose and setup the perfect domain.</p>
<p>Cost of hosting support plan (includes security updates, regular backups and more):<br /> <strong>£79 / month</strong></p>
