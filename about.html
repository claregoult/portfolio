<p>I’m a designer from <strike>sunny</strike> England. I specialise in branding, identity design, and web design, for business owners looking to up their branding game. I work with my clients to help them tell stories visually, bringing vision to life and capturing the personality of their brand through design branding identities.</p>



<h4 class="sub-section-title">5 random facts about me:</h4>

<ol>
	<li>I love watching Doctor Who. Some say I’m obsessed. I say <em>exterminate!</em> <small>They may have a point...</small></li>
	<li>I drink copious amounts of tea.</li>
	<li>I am inspired by fashion, interior design, art, photography, and the world around me.</li>
	<li>I welcome our feline overlords. I am told they are as benevolent as they are fair.</li>
	<li>I once fell over a pig whilst walking backwards… Don’t ask!</li>

<p>I’m likely not the first designer you’ve come across today. With more design agencies and freelancers than ever offering their services it can be frustrating and confusing deciding who to choose from. More so when you can easily find people on social media offer to design you a website for free. There are even entire companies dedicated to logos starting at $5 (USD). I’m asuming you’re here because you want something with a more value than $5. If you want to read more about the value of a logo then you should read my blog post on the subject: <a href="https://goult.design/2017/12/23/value-of-logo">https://goult.design/2017/12/23/value-of-logo</a>
</p>

<p>So, with so many options available to you why should you want to work with me?</p>
<ul>

<li>I work closely with clients and because it’s only me working on your project it’s a little more personal — you know who you’re working with — and I can give you my full attention.</li>

<li>I work to establish what your goals and values are as a brand, as well as determine what you want to achieve, and how you fit into your industry.</li>

<li>Design is more than choosing a pretty typeface or making something look good. If it doesn’t solve your problems then what good is it? Design should seek to achieve your goals and solve a problem whilst still being visually appealing.</li>

<li>I only accept clients I’m interested in working with rather than churning out designs simply for the sake of money. This avoids becoming complacent, stagnant and ensures we’re both passionate about creating something great.</li>
</ul>

<p>My goal, as a designer, is to help you succeed in your goals by creating a solution that meets your requirements. I also try to make sure everything is easy to understand and the final product is easy to use and maintain going forward. It’s no good making a website you can’t update or a logo you can’t print because nobody can open it!</p>

<p>I work mostly by myself but if it’s something outside the area of my expertise or something I don’t feel confident enough in, then I’ll work with you to help you find reliable people or studios who might be able to help.</p>

<p>Let’s get started.</p>

If you want to the process behind how I create branding that uplift businesses then then you should go and read my <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/services">services page</a>.

<section class="section values">

<h3 class="section-title ">Values/Standards</h3>
<div class="grid-container">
<div class="column">
<h4 class="sub-section-title">Be Transparant</h4>
<p>
Trust is the foundation of any relationship. That's why I like to be honest about everything in the project, including pricing and expectations, so my clients feel comfortable throughout the process.
</p>
</div>
<div class="column">
<h4 class="sub-section-title">Be Kind</h4>
<p>
My clients are great people to work with. I will always treat them with the kindess and the respect they deserve. It costs nothing to be kind and I think everyone deserves to be treated fairly.
</p>
</div>
<div class="column">
<h4 class="sub-section-title">People Not Profits</h4>
<p>
The success of a project is measured by positive experiences not how much money I can get out of a client. I want to help people, not take advantage of them.
</p>
</div>
<div class="column">
<h4 class="sub-section-title">Keep Learning</h4>
<p>
It's easy to stop learning once you've finished school. I think people should always try to enrich their lives with knowledge and passion. I try to learn from my clients as much as they might learn about the design process from me.
</p>
</div>
<div class="column">
<h4 class="sub-section-title">Quality not Quantity</h4>
<p>
If I want to provide a positive experience then I can't just churn out work. That's why I work on only a select few client at a time to ensure my clients have my full attention and creative effort.
</p>
</div>
<div class="column">
<h4 class="sub-section-title">Work To Live</h4>
<p>
Work is only one part of my life, and I aim to keep it that way. When we prioritise our families and passions we're healthier and happier people. I try to keep that in mind as I foster creative passion in others.
</p>
</div>
<div class="column">
<h4 class="sub-section-title">Always Ask Questions</h4>
<p>
I want to create the best solution I can for my clients and that starts by asking questions. If I don't understand the project then how can I be expected to deliver something they're happy with?
</p>
</div>
<div class="column">
<h4 class="sub-section-title">Keep It Simple</h4>
<p>
Simplicity means clarity. If it's clear then it's understandable. I try to keep evertything as simple as possible. That means I won't bore clients with technical jargon or design an elaborate concept I can't actually complete. Many of best things in the world are, at their core, simple.
