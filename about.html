<h2 class="section-title">Hi, I’m Clare Goult. It’s a pleasure to meet you!</h2>


<p>I’m a designer from <strike>sunny</strike> England. I specialise in branding, identity design, and web design for business owners looking to up their branding game. I work with my clients to help them tell stories visually, bring their vision to life and capture the personality of their brand through design branding identities. It’s my goal in life to make the world a more visually pleasing place.</p>

	<li>I drink copious amounts of tea.</li>
	<li>I am inspired by fashion, interior design, art, photography, and the world around me.</li>
	<li>I welcome our feline overlords. I am told they are as benevolent as they are fair.</li>

<h3 class="section-title ">Values/Standards</h3>
<div class="grid-container">
<div class="column">
<h4 class="sub-section-title">Be Transparant</h4>
<p>
Trust is the foundation of any relationship. That's why I like to be honest about everything in the project, including pricing and expectations, so my clients feel comfortable throughout the process.
</p>
</div>
<div class="column">
<h4 class="sub-section-title">Be Kind</h4>
<p>
My clients are great people to work with. I will always treat them with the kindess and the respect they deserve. It costs nothing to be kind and I think everyone deserves to be treated fairly.
</p>
</div>
<div class="column">
<h4 class="sub-section-title">People Not Profits</h4>
<p>
The success of a project is measured by positive experiences not how much money I can get out of a client. I want to help people, not take advantage of them.
</p>
</div>
<div class="column">
<h4 class="sub-section-title">Keep Learning</h4>
<p>
It's easy to stop learning once you've finished school. I think people should always try to enrich their lives with knowledge and passion. I try to learn from my clients as much as they might learn about the design process from me.
</p>
</div>
<div class="column">
<h4 class="sub-section-title">Quality not Quantity</h4>
<p>
If I want to provide a positive experience then I can't just churn out work. That's why I work on only a select few client at a time to ensure my clients have my full attention and creative effort.
</p>
</div>
<div class="column">
<h4 class="sub-section-title">Work To Live</h4>
<p>
Work is only one part of my life, and I aim to keep it that way. When we prioritise our families and passions we're healthier and happier people. I try to keep that in mind as I foster creative passion in others.
</p>
</div>
<div class="column">
<h4 class="sub-section-title">Always Ask Questions</h4>
<p>
I want to create the best solution I can for my clients and that starts by asking questions. If I don't understand the project then how can I be expected to deliver something they're happy with?
</p>
</div>
<div class="column">
<h4 class="sub-section-title">Keep It Simple</h4>
<p>
Simplicity means clarity. If it's clear then it's understandable. I try to keep evertything as simple as possible. That means I won't bore clients with technical jargon or design an elaborate concept I can't actually complete. Many of best things in the world are, at their core, simple.
